# The Story of the First 100

The First 100 as a very small grass roots campaign to raise money for the Water Protectors in Standing Rock North Dakota. It all started with a small local store in the mountain of North Carolina that trained their staff to ask every customer one simple question, "Would you be willing to donate $1 or more to Standing Rock?"

The immediate support and loving reactions they got from their community was overwhelming! The first day they collected $100 and that was before everyone was properly trained or even knew what has happening at Standing Rock. Then they had an idea... What if 100 local small businesses like us collected $100 a day also? Would others be interested in helping the cause?

Think about it... If 100 business collected $100 dollars a day that would be $10,000 a day and $300,000 a month! That is the kind of money that can really make a difference. They then realized that if it was that easy to get 100 businesses in one city, what if 1000 cities participated? The number became staggering. With only small companies the average daily could topple over $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 A DAY!! 

So now we bring it you to you, the person reading this. Would you be willing to participate in saving millions of lives and getting resources to the places that need them most in the world?
